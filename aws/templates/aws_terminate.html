<h2>Terminate Cluster - {{ cluster.cluster_name }}</h2>
<p>
Click below to terminate cluster {{ cluster.cluster_name }}.
<br /><br />
<b>Any attached EBS volumes will be deleted.</b>  If you attached any<br />
EBS volumes to your cluster, we recommend you first snapshot data<br />
you would like to save via the AWS Management Console.<br /><br />
After the termination action completes, log into your AWS<br />
Management Console and refresh your view to confirm your cluster's<br />
EC2 instances have terminated and any EBS volumes are deleted.<br /><br />
You are solely responsible for all charges to your AWS account.
