    <br />
   <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">
        <p>The HPCC Systems Instant Cloud for AWS software and service (this "Service") is made 
        available by LexisNexis Risk Data Management Inc. d/b/a HPCC Systems 
        ("Provider") and all content, information, services and software 
        provided by or through this Service may be used solely under these 
        terms and conditions ("Terms of Use"). Your use of the Service, which 
        requires Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), must also comply with your 
        separate agreement with Amazon Web Services LLC or its affiliates, 
        which are not affiliated with Provider. You may not use the Service

  <h3>1. License</h3>
    <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">
        <p>You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, 
        worldwide, revocable license to access and use the Service only for its 
        intended purpose and in accordance with these Terms of Use. Provider 
        may suspend or terminate your Service and this license at any time if 
        Provider believes your use of the Service violates your license.  
        Ownership of this software and all other rights in the Service are 
        reserved by Provider. The purpose of the Service is to install and 
        assist you with managing on AWS your HPCC Systems Community Edition 
        Thor cluster ("Cluster"). </p>
    </div>    
 <h3>2. Account Access</h3>
    <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">
        <p>By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that Provider will 
        use the Amazon Security Credentials you provide to access your account 
        and will do so to fulfill requests you make through this site.  
        Provider does not store your access key, and you will be required to 
        furnish them each time you access this site. Provider will also have 
        access to SSH private keys generated by the site to fulfill your 
        request, but you may delete your SSH keys after your Cluster 
        configuration completes. Provider is not liable for mistakes or 
        errors made to your AWS account including loss of service or loss 
        of data, including loss or misplacement of SSH keys we generate for 
        you. If you do not wish to or cannot give Provider such access it 
        needs to perform the Service based on these Terms of Use, you may 
        choose to instead install and manage your AWS and HPCC Systems 
        Community Edition cluster using other means.</p>
    </div>       
 <h3>3. HPCC Systems Community Edition Software</h3>

        Systems software. By using the Service and your Cluster you accept the

 <h3>4. Responsibility with Use</h3>
    <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">
        <p>Between you and Provider, you are fully responsible for using the 
        Service and your Cluster and any charges arising from your use of the 
        Service and your Cluster. Provider assumes no responsibility concerning 
        a third party's functionality, content, software, or other aspect 
        related to the Service or your Cluster. You may use the Service only 
        for lawful purposes and may only load content for which you have 
        sufficient rights to load. You may not use the Service or your 
        Cluster for any unlawful, harmful, wrongful, or malicious purpose,
        to be determined at the sole discretion of Provider. You will indemnify
        Provider for any damages incurred or liabilities claimed by a third 
        party arising from your use of the Service or your Cluster, except to 
        the extent the damages are directly caused by an act or omission of 
        Provider.</p>
    </div>        
 <h3>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
    <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PROVIDER OFFERS 
        THIS SERVICE SOLELY ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITH NO 
        WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE

 <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">
        <p>While you may incur charges from other parties when using the Service
        or your Cluster, Provider does not charge you, and the limitations of 
        liability in this paragraph reflect such bargain between the parties.  
        Provider is not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, 
        consequential, or exemplary damages arising out of or relating to the 
        Service, your use of the Service, and your Cluster, including, but not
        limited to, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, loss of data,
        and computer failure, even if Provider is advised of the possibility 
        of such damages or liability and regardless of whether the claim arises
        in contract, tort, or another legal basis. Regardless of the cause of
        action, in no event will Provider be liable to you for any amounts
        related to the Service, in the aggregate, above ten US dollars. Provider
        may cease providing the Service in its sole discretion at any time and 
        without prior notice.</p>
    </div>        

 <h3>7. Miscellaneous</h3>
    <div style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-left:30px;border:0px solid;">

        its rights and obligations to any third party without the prior written
        consent of Provider. If any part of these Terms of Use is held to be 
        unenforceable, the remainder shall remain valid and fully effective.  
        The waiver of any right or obligation by Provider herein shall not be 
        deemed to be a waiver of all of Provider's rights and obligations nor 
        may it be interpreted as a waiver of the right or obligation in the 
        future. These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of 
        Georgia, United States, excluding its conflicts of law rules and without
        application of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale 
        of Goods. Any lawsuit must be brought exclusively in the state or 
        federal courts located in Atlanta, Georgia. Any amendment or 
        modification of these Terms of Use by you must be in a writing signed 
        by authorized representatives of each party and expressly identifying 
        these Terms of Use. Provider may update these Terms of Use from time to
        time by updating this site, and your continued use of the Service will 
        be interpreted as your agreement to the revised version. Your use of 
        the Service shall be interpreted as your agreement with these Terms of 
        Use, without modification.</p>
